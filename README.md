  YT-DLPGM is a small upgrade to YT-DLP to make it slightly more friendly to new users.
</p></b>

### Background

<p align="left">
  I had been a user of YT-DLG for many years, but one day the program stopped working for me. I did some research and YT-DLP seemed like a good alternative, but it was   somewhat irritating to use the terminal exclusively and all the other GUIs didn't have the file format flexibility I was looking for. So, I decided to learn some Batch and make my own GUI-ish application for the program.
</p>

<p align="left">
  I call it a GUI-ish, -esque, or as the name puts it, -mini because of the simple fact that while there is technically a UI (at least more than the base YT-DLP) it is not as graphics heavy or intense as some of the other YT-DLP or YT-DL-based GUIs I've seen.
</p>

  So why make something new if there are already similar projects out there? Well I wanted to make something for people like myself, people that need videos in perhaps weird file formats or just need a program that works with no learning curve. That is the goal of YT-DLP GM, and the reason I wrote it. Updates will come out when I think to add or get suggestions to add something, so feel free to suggest in the discussion section. Happy downloading!
